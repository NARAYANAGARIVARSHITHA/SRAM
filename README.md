Designed memory of size 8x 8 using 6T-SRAM cell.
This project implements an 8×8 Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), consisting of 8 words with 8 bits per word. The design demonstrates fundamental SRAM architecture and operation, including memory cell design, row/column decoding, read/write circuitry, and control logic.
